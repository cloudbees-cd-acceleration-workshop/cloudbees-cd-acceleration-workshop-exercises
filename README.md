## https://github.com/cloudbees-cd-acceleration-workshop/cloudbees-cd-acceleration-workshop-exercises

This repository contains the instructions and learning materials associated with a hands-on workshop **CD Acceleration with CloudBees Core** that is designed to teach the following key concepts:

  * How do CloudBees Pipeline features accelerate continuous delivery?
  * What are Jenkins Pipelines and why should you use them?
  * Why should you *mostly* use [Declarative](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) vs [Scripted](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) pipelines?
  * How to create a simple Jenkins Declarative Pipeline?
  * What are the key features of Declarative Pipelines?
  * How do you create multibranch pipelines?
